# Shuffle-Dice-Game
This is a web development project where I have used my initial learning of DOM manipulation and developed a small game. Here the user will have to refresh the pages to get random dice images of player 1 and player 2. Depending on the dice value result is shown. This is achieved using the Math.random().
